I'm kayak (don't capitalise it). I build websites, mentor people who aren't quite as experienced as me, and do my best to learn from people who are.

I try to be active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/by-k4y4k) and you can take a peek at my projects on [GitHub](), if you're that kind of person.

## I'm currently looking for work!

You can hit me up on Twitter, or send an [email](mailto:work.by.kayak@gmail.com), if that's more your speed.
