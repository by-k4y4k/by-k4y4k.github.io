I'm kayak (yes, as in the small boat you paddle). I build websites, mentor people who aren't quite as experienced as me, and do my best to learn from people who have a few more `console.log()` calls under their belt than I do.

## I'm looking for work!

You can chat to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/by-k4y4k)! There's always [email](mailto:work.by.kayak@gmail.com) too, if Twitter's not your speed. You can also take a peek at my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/by-k4y4k).
