So I’m not a complete newcomer, but I struggle to stick with Udemy courses. Eventually, the desire to make something for myself that wasn’t just the course project became too strong and I decided to do something about it.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I installed the CLI (which was its own, unrelated hassle), pulled down the default starter, and got started on the tutorial. Let me say just one thing about the tutorial: <em>it’s amazing!</em> Not only is it easy to follow, but I was able to come back later and pick it apart when my site needed some functionality that I knew I'd done before.</p>\n<p>The only thing that I can really complain about is that Gatsby, being, you know, a <em>framework,</em> adds a lot of invisible wrapper components that add a lot of noise to the React Dev Tools. It was a bit of a shock the first time I wanted to debug what was happening to my own component, props-wise, and had to open about 15 layers of Gatsby-added components before I even got to the root of my site. But, really, that's just a minor thing - especially when I can eye-drop the component I want to look at.</p>\n<h2>I sort of understand React now</h2>\n<p>Before, when I said that I had done a few sections of a Udemy course, that might have been impressive.</p>\n<p>You might ask me questions such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"What did you make?\"</li>\n<li>\"What did you learn?\"</li>\n<li>\"Is React really that hard to learn?\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unfortunately for (the hypothetical) you, I would have just stared blankly. I don't know the component lifecycle, I didn't make a to-do list, I can't tell you about what React Hooks to use when, and I definitely still don't understand the intricacies of Webpack.</p>\n<p>I don't really <em>get</em> React.</p>\n<p>But that's all right. I don't need to know these things for Gatsby, for my first project, for the codebase that gets me comfy with components. Of course, I <em>should</em> learn these things. But I don't <em>need</em> them.</p>\n<p>What I'm trying to say is that I'm less intimidated by React now. Gatsby might be a framework - so it's not <em>really</em> React - but I figure it's better for showing off my learning than some class exercises that hundreds of thousands of other students have also done.</p>\n<h2>The meta</h2>\n<p>I've learned a few nifty tricks over the course of the week and a bit working on this project.</p>\n<h3>Snippets</h3>\n<p>Once I got the hang of styled-components (which took about three hours, thanks to their <a href=\"https://www.styled-components.com/docs/basics#getting-started\">amazing docs</a>), I soon realised that I was, essentially, hand-typing the same <code class=\"language-text\">import</code> / <code class=\"language-text\">export</code> statements over and over again.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> React <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'react'</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> styled <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'styled-components'</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"token function-variable function\">Name</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>className<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> children<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> StyledName <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">styled</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>Name<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token template-string\"><span class=\"token template-punctuation string\">`</span><span class=\"token template-punctuation string\">`</span></span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">default</span> StyledName</code></pre></div>\n<p>So I set up some snippets in my editor (<a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">Visual Studio Code</a>). You can copy the following into your own snippets settings if you do a lot of work with styled-components too (<code class=\"language-text\">ctrl</code>+<code class=\"language-text\">shift</code>+<code class=\"language-text\">p</code> -> <code class=\"language-text\">Preferences: Configure User Snippets</code>)!</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\">  <span class=\"token property\">\"styled-components\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"prefix\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"ims\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"body\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"import styled from 'styled-components';\"</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"component w/ styled-components export\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"prefix\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"rco\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"body\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>\n      <span class=\"token string\">\"const ${1:Name} = ({className, children}) => {$0}\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n      <span class=\"token string\">\"\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n      <span class=\"token string\">\"const Styled${1:Name} = styled(${1:Name})``\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n      <span class=\"token string\">\"\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n      <span class=\"token string\">\"export default Styled${1:Name}\"</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h3>The GitHub repo</h3>\n<p>With this project, I decided to try some things I've seen around but never had the chance to try for myself. One of these was <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\">Netlify</a>, which I've set up to preview deploy all of the Pull Requests I do.</p>\n<p>I've also set up <a href=\"https://app.codacy.com/project/by-k4y4k/by-k4y4k.github.io/dashboard\">Codacy</a>, as I've got nobody else to blame for the code than myself, and a second pair of eyes - even if they are robotic - can't hurt.</p>\n<p>Not only that, but I've also enabled a neat little tool called <a href=\"https://greenkeeper.io\">Greenkeeper</a> to manage my <code class=\"language-text\">package.json</code> dependencies. What Greenkeeper does is it creates a Pull Request for any <em>out-of-range</em> dependencies and makes sure all the usual Pull Request tests pass with the updated dependency. It's pretty great.</p>\n<h2>Now What?</h2>\n<p>I've got a few things I want to achieve over the next week, namely:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Implement some kind of TDD on my website</li>\n<li>Finish my website</li>\n<li>Fill out the portfolio</li>\n<li>Get a resume together</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I've heard a few buzzwords and common names when it comes to React and TDD (Jest, anyone?), but I'm yet to try it out for myself. Hopefully, I can get the hang of it without too many tears.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Weekly Roundup 1","date":"28-06-19"},"timeToRead":4,"wordCount":{"words":805},"parent":{"prettySize":"5.55 kB","name":"weekly-roundup-1"},"excerpt":"I've been pushing a few of my friends to do one of these every week while being slack myself.
